As a scientist, I wanted to analyze and plot some publicly available data.
This app retrieves API data of stock and displays the results.

## Progress
### (6/28/2020 - 6/30/2020) First goal -- done
input a stock symbol -> display a chart

## Future plans
add other features such as News, some analysis (moving average, etc)
